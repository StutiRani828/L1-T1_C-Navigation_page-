    <h1>ONLINE VOTING SYSTEM</h1>
    <p id="para">An online voting system is a digital platform designed to allow voters to cast their votes electronically via the internet. It aims to enhance the voting process by making it more secure, efficient, and accessible. Key features of such a system include user authentication, ballot management, secure vote casting, and reliable vote storage and counting. Security measures are critical and involve encryption, blockchain technology for transparency, end-to-end verification, and intrusion detection systems to guard against unauthorized access and tampering. The benefits of an online voting system include increased accessibility, convenience, faster vote tallying, and cost savings by reducing the need for physical infrastructure. However, challenges such as security threats, ensuring voter privacy, addressing the digital divide, and complying with legal regulations must be carefully managed. Technologies used in developing online voting systems include web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), back-end languages (Python, Java, C++), databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle), and cloud services (Oracle Cloud, AWS, Azure). The implementation process involves requirement analysis, system design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Notable examples of online voting systems include Estoniaâ€™s i-Voting System, Voatz, and POLYAS, which have been used in various elections and referendums to demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of electronic voting.</p>
